*Sprint Review*

- sprint goal was achieved
- all selected user stories were completed
- all tests passing
- basic GUI is functional
  - one known bug: crashes when "Edit venue" button is pressed with no venue selected
- documentation is up to date



*Sprint Retrospective*

- the sprint started slowly but progressed well, with a implementable GUI performing the methods required
- more functionality could have been added to the business layer, to create a more "complete" GUI, closer to the expected final product'
- methods written thus far function as planned, with successful GUI interaction
- planning and building the database was not trouble free.  Database may have to be redesigned in a further sprint
- GUI layer needs better direction as to how it's final appearance will be - this required more thought and planning from the start
- code could be refactored in places
