## *Project_Goal*

*To build a 3 tier application that manages events bookings.  Functionality to sell tickets, add and remove events, update event information, and ensure events don't oversell their capacity*.



## *Definition_of_Done*

- [ ] Database is generated and populated
- [ ] All MVP Project User Stories have been coded to be functional
- [ ] All code is tested and refactored 

- [ ] GUI front end is usable and interacts with all CRUD operations, and is bug free

- [ ] Code is well commented and readable

- [ ] Product has been reviewed and approved

- [ ] Class diagram is updated

- [ ] ReadME.md file is written and clear

- [ ] All documentation is uploaded to GitHub

- [ ] Presentation is well planned and ready to be delivered

  

## *User_Definition_of_Done*

- [ ] The criteria for the story is met
- [ ] The code is fully tested
- [ ] The GUI interacts with the code
- [ ] Code is reviewed
- [ ] Progress is documented



## *Sprint_One*

*Goals*

- [x] Add acceptance criteria to this sprints user stories

 - [x] Database created and events added

 - [x] Business layer interacts with DB

 - [x] Methods written to add and remove venues from DB

 - [x] Above methods well tested

 - [x] GUI created with basic functionality working

 - [x] All code is well commented

 - [x] Documentation is up-to-date and uploaded to GitHub

   

*Sprint Review*

- sprint goal was achieved
- all selected user stories were completed
- all tests passing
- basic GUI is functional
  - one known bug: crashes when "Edit venue" button is pressed with no venue selected
- documentation is up to date



*Sprint Retrospective*

- the sprint started slowly but progressed well, with a implementable GUI performing the methods required

- more functionality could have been added to the business layer, to create a more "complete" GUI, closer to the expected final product'

- methods written thus far function as planned, with successful GUI interaction

- planning and building the database was not trouble free.  Database may have to be redesigned in a further sprint

- GUI layer needs better direction as to how it's final appearance will be - this required more thought and planning from the start

- code could be refactored in places

  

## *Sprint_Two*

*Goals*

**Sprint Two Goal**

 - [x] Add acceptance criteria to this sprints user stories. Be more explicit with user stories

 - [x] Plan vision for how completed GUI needs to look

 - [x] Complete commenting not finished during sprint one

 - [x] Review testing from sprint one, and ensure tests are complete

 - [x] Add the sport type and music genre tables to my database

 - [x] Methods written to add, remove and edit events

 - [x] Ensure event methods interact with venues (an event needs a venue!)

 - [x] GUI is updated to interact with event functionality

 - [ ] Refactor code

 - [ ] Ensure GUI runs completely bug free

 - [ ] Document all bugs, and when debugged

 - [ ] All code is well commented

 - [x] Documentation is up-to-date and uploaded to GitHub

   

*Sprint Review*

- sprint goal was not fully achieved
- all selected user stories were completed
- all tests passing
- database was updated and provides a far better base to develop the app on
- refactoring still needed, some debugging needed, some code could be better commented
- GUI is nearly complete, functionality is good, bar a couple of bugs
- documentation is up to date



*Sprint Retrospective*

- the sprint was successful, the extra weekend time was made good sue of
- all methods written so far function well, with good GUI interaction
- happy with the database, though in future iterations of the project would like to further develop the DB
- GUI layers design was better planned out, and plans were put into place successfully
- code could be refactored, but MVP should be achieved by the end of sprint 3
- need to remember to document bugs, before and after fixed.  Will try to better implement in sprint 3
